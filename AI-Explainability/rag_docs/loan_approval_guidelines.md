All automated credit decisions must be explainable and auditable.
Customers are entitled to clear, understandable reasons for approval or rejection decisions.

Loan approval requires satisfying multiple criteria across credit quality, debt capacity, and income stability.
No single factor automatically guarantees approval or rejection - holistic assessment is required.

Borderline cases (approval confidence 50-70%) may be escalated for manual review.
Applications with contradictory signals (excellent credit but high DSR) require human judgment.

Rejection reasons must cite specific policy violations to enable customer understanding.
Approved applications should highlight strengths that supported the positive decision.
