**Act 1: The Customer**
> "Meet Sarah. She just applied for a mortgage and got approved at 6.25%. But why that rate?
> 
> Sarah sees her decision broken down into factors she understands: her strong credit score 
> helped, but her single late payment last year nudged her rate slightly higher.
> 
> She can even explore: 'If I had paid down more debt, what rate could I have gotten?' 
> The answer: 5.875%. Now she knows exactly what to do before refinancing."

**Act 2: The Loan Officer**
> "Now let's see what Marcann at the bank sees.
> 
> He gets the full picture: values showing exactly how each factor weighted the decision,
> the rules that fired, and most importantly — similar past cases from the RAG system.
> 
> The AI cites the exact internal policy and regulation that applies. No more guessing, 
> no more inconsistency between officers."

**Act 3: The Regulator**
> "Finally, the auditor's view.
> 
> Complete compliance checklist against ECOA, FCRA, and TILA. A timestamped audit trail 
> of every system action. Fairness metrics showing the model performs consistently across 
> demographics.
> 
> Every decision is traceable. Every factor is documented. Every regulation is mapped."
